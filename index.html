        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>One of my strengths is empathising with users and I believe that every deisgn project starts with a thourough understanding of users and the problems they experience.  I have used tools such as affinity diagran, user personas, user journey maps and problem statement generation.  In the research phase, I often use tools such as Miro, Figma and the Google suite. </p>

        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
        <p>I have completed several design projects using tools such as Adobe XD and Figma. I like to start designing with low-fidelity prototypes and get user feedback early in the design process.  I attempt to test prototypes as much as possible before finalizing designs in a high-fidelity prototype.</p>

          <h4>Remotely: A travel app</h4>
          <p>An project from my UX/UI bootcamp at the University of Utah was to design a mobile app related to travel.  For this project, I worked with one classmate to design a mobile app for vacationers who are looking to book a vacation that is ‘off the beaten path’.</p>

          <h4>Fridge Fresh: A mobile app</h4>
          <p>This project was a challenge to solve an everyday problem.  My teammates and I designed an app that would allow users to keep track of what groceries they had in their refrigerator. The app is designed to allow users to scan barcodes and also reccomends recipes bason on the ingredients that you have available.</p>
